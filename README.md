### Configuration ###

There is a single variable in the workflow configuration screen (open the workflow in Alfred Preferences and hit the `[ùíô]` button): `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`. You must set this to use Google Maps search. You can get an API key [here](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key).

### Importing Searches ###

Searchio! has the ability to import a search configuration from any website that supports the OpenSearch autosuggestion API.

Run `searchio` > `Import Search ‚Ä¶` and the workflow will offer to import a search from a URL on your clipboard, the frontmost Safari tab or the frontmost Chrome tab.

It will try to find and read the OpenSearch description at the URL and import it (and the website's icon if available), then ask you to assign a keyword for the search.

**NOTE**: Although many websites support OpenSearch, few support the autosuggestion API that Searchio! uses. Sites based on MediaWiki usually support the API, so you can add all your favourite Wikia wikis (the built-in Wikia engine only supports the few hundred most popular wikis).
